NEW TODO - the logs containing tracking versus measurement need to be sorted by time.  This doesn't become a problem until 
chrony is running over a cell phone hotspot with a mediocre connection.  

The error handling is much better.

Needs better / extant error handling upon chrony startup.  I have some handling when PHP errors are set to show, but this probably needs friendly 
user-level messages.
