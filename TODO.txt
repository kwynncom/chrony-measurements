create a utility that keeps track of where you left off in a file and hands you the file handle opened to (seek'ed to) the place you left off

There should not be a (unique) index on U.  Better _id management.  Rearrange get_oids() for seconds in order
The chrony log goes backwards in time sometimes; account for that.

I can't show the two directions with the NTP stuff, only NIST.
Combine NIST with other table to show both directions
add the asymmetry score from statistics

averages rather than last, network time (both ways)

the sorting as below is done.

NEW TODO - the logs containing tracking versus measurement need to be sorted by time.  This doesn't become a problem until 
chrony is running over a cell phone hotspot with a mediocre connection.  

The error handling is much better.


ca 5pm EST / New York

Needs better / extant error handling upon chrony startup.  I have some handling when PHP errors are set to show, but this probably needs friendly 
user-level messages.
