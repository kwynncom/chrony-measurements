		<h2>more status info</h2>
		
		<p>On June 16, 2023, between 17:00 - 17:30 US Eastern Daylight Time, the Maryland NIST servers seem to have gone offline.
			I set chrony to include IPv6 servers in both Fort Collins and Boulder, Colorado.  I also set my cron job that checks 
			time to only point at the 4 IPv6 Colorado servers.  
			
		</p>
		
		<p>When the Maryland servers are working, I expect 90% of polls to show lower than 0.4 ms offset.  The offset to Colorado 
			seems to be 1.0 - 1.1.  So, I've set my alarm tolerence from 1ms to 1.4ms.
