# chrony-measurements
quick assessment of chrony's accuracy

My purpose is to add details to my accurate clock widget: 

https://kwynn.com/t/9/12/sync/
https://github.com/kwynncom/javascript-synchronized-clock

I have found that Chrony's own assessment of accuracy, which is all that is displayed now, is not useful in itself.  I plan to add details to that 
widget that give a far more complete assessment.
